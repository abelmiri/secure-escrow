# Constants Directory

This directory contains application constants, configuration values, and enums.

## Structure
- Group related constants together
- Use TypeScript `const` assertions for type safety
- Export as named exports

## Example
```
constants/
  routes.ts
  api.ts
  theme.ts
  enums.ts
```

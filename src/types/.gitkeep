# Types Directory

This directory contains shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and type definitions.

## Structure
- Global types that are used across multiple components
- Feature-specific types can be co-located with components
- Use descriptive names: `user.types.ts`, `api.types.ts`, etc.

## Example
```
types/
  index.ts          # Re-exports all types
  user.types.ts
  api.types.ts
  common.types.ts
```

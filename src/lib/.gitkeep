# Library/Utilities Directory

This directory contains utility functions, helpers, and shared logic.

## Structure
- Utility functions should be organized by domain/feature
- Each utility file should export typed functions
- Use `.ts` extension (not `.tsx`) for non-component files

## Example
```
lib/
  api/
    client.ts
    endpoints.ts
  utils/
    format.ts
    validation.ts
```
